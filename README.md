# ðŸ”µ Classification with Make Circles and ReLU ðŸ”´

This project demonstrates how to approach a **non-linear classification problem** using the `make_circles` dataset from **scikit-learn**.  
The notebook shows how neural networks with **ReLU activation âš¡** can be applied to separate data that is not linearly separable.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- ðŸ“’ `Make_circles.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the dataset generation, visualization, and the implementation of classification using ReLU.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

The main goal of this project is to provide a simple and clear example of how to handle non-linear classification problems by leveraging the `make_circles` dataset and applying a neural network model with the **ReLU activation function**.
