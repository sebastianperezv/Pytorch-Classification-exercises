# ðŸ”µ PyTorch Classification Exercises ðŸ”´

This repository contains a set of **practical exercises in PyTorch** focused on **binary classification and non-linear multi-class classification problems**.  
The main goal is to understand and apply fundamental concepts of neural networks, activation functions, and model training for classification tasks.

The notebook `Pytorch_Classification_exercises.ipynb` includes:

- **Binary Classification**  
  - Building a perceptron for two-class classification.  
  - Using activation functions such as **Sigmoid**.  
  - Training and evaluating the model.  

- **Non-linear Multi-class Classification**  
  - Modeling problems with more than two classes.  
  - Implementing **ReLU** and **Softmax** in the neural network.  
  - Computing performance metrics.  

- **Applied concepts:**  
  - Tensors in PyTorch.
